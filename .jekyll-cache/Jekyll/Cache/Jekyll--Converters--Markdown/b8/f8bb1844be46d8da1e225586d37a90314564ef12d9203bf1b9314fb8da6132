I"§<p>This article is about something we call versioning. It is one of the basic things you have to set up when developing software. Youâ€™ve probably heard the word Git before. This is one of the most widely used version control systems. Other related names you may hear are: SVN, Mecurial, GitLab, GitHub, BitBucket, Azure devops or AWS code commit.</p>

Most of us have to deal with Office and OneDrive or Google Docs and Drive. The source file is somewhere on a server (often in the cloud) and anyone who has access can make changes to it. If you make a change locally (on your computer), I will see this reflected in the document on my computer. We can open the document in an editor (Word) but also in the browser if we want.</p>

<p>While Iâ€™m typing this blog, I see that it is also immediately saved to Google Drive:
