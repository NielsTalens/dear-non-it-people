<p>Low-code means that you can make software products without mastering a programming language. You often do this on a low-code development platform that provides the environment on which you can do this. In theory, you do this by selecting existing elements that you then put on pages in your application. You can compare the idea a bit with how you create pages in Wordpress, Confluence or Microsoft Teams and put different elements on them.</p>
