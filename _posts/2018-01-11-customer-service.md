IT is often a black box for 'outsiders' with its own jargon, many abbreviations and often even its own culture. Things often sound very complex and new buzzwords pop up regularly with a new promise of speed, cost savings and future stability. Unfortunately, you don't always see these things reflected in the business. Still, you will be surprised at how relatively simple many IT things can be. Or better: should be. In a number of short blog posts I will try to explain some of the latest buzzwords and concepts so that they are understandable and you can better sense whether effort is being put into the right things at the right time.

#### How to use?

You have probably heard the term technical debt from time to time. It's often used as an explanation of why we cannot create and deploy as fast and flexible as we want or need. Why the throughput of a new feature is so long.

The thing with debt, like taking a loan at the bank, buying stuff on credit or the choice to allow technical debt, is that there is a conscious choice made to create this debt even if it seems the choice is sometimes made by others.



And just like any debt, someone will have to pay off the technical debt. The bigger the debt, the more it hurts. Now the question remains: who is responsible and who will pay off the debt?
